Concepts: The Question of Ethics
{{< tdclose >}}
{{< tdopen >}}

Within this context, what is an ethical compromise? What is the ethics of planners remaining "neutral"? What responsibility should influence their practice? What is the source of ethical values? What ethical framework governs a context of radical cultural pluralism, as in a Western planner working in non-Western countries?
