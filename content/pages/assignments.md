Class Discussion
----------------

Students are asked to participate fully in class discussions on an ongoing basis, as the processes of interactive deliberation and reflection on past experiences are considered essential to appreciating the relationship between development theory and practice.

Reaction Papers
---------------

Each student will write two short reaction papers (three pages each) to readings in two assigned classes (one in Ses #5 and one in Ses #12) that make a short, cogent analysis of the readings assigned for that day, in the light of the questions presented by the instructor. She or he will briefly explain:

1.  The main issues raised by the topic under discussion;
2.  How the readings address the questions raised;
3.  How the readings differ with each other if they do and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses;

Group Project Presentation
--------------------------

Students will be required to make a group presentation following the completion of roughly 50% of the course. It can either be a group report in a traditional Powerpoint format or a group project in the form of a video or multimedia presentation. In either case, the groups will present their own proposed solutions to specific problems posed in specific countries and at specific scales. The presentations will be judged on comprehensiveness, creativity, and feasibility.

Final Paper
-----------

Each student will be required to write one final paper, not to exceed 20 double-spaced pages (excluding references). The paper will adhere to academic integrity and reference standards.
